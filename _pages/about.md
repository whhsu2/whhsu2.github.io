I just graduated from Harvard Health Data Science program and currently am working at Aetna as a Software Engineer. Previously I studied Nano Science at NCTU in Taiwan, mainly focusing on semiconductor fabrication. Since then, I have taken a huge pivot, now I am a software developer that focus on digitising the healthcare experience.

In leasure time, I write about random stuff that I'm interested in (my blog posts). I write some full stack and front end projects. Besides coding, I started to learn Piano and reading sheet music since the quarantine. Huge fan of FKJ ( French Kiwi Juice).
