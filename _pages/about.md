I'm a data engineer at Aetna in New York. Currently working in Spark to build ML models to increase our member engagement. I'm interested in using Machine learning to digitise the healthcare experience. 

Previously, I studied semiconductors at [NCTU](https://www.google.com/maps/place/National+Yangming+Jiaotong+University/@24.7868862,120.9974969,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x3929da7f3a723e9a!8m2!3d24.7868862!4d120.9974969) ( National Chiao Tung University), served in the marine in Taiwan, graduated from Harvard Health Data Science and worked at a start up. 


In leasure time, I write about random stuff that I'm interested in. I write some full stack and front end projects. Besides coding, I started to learn Piano and reading sheet music since the quarantine. Huge fan of FKJ ([my fav song of his](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk7Hx9eNrmU))
